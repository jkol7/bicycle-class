# Bicycle Class

Index.php shows a form that helps build a new bicycle object based on a bicycle class.

The bicycle will need all standard components to ride.

MPH can be increased or decreased by pedalling and gear shifting.

# How to Run

Visit your localhost to set inputs and try to ride the bicycle and see your MPH.
